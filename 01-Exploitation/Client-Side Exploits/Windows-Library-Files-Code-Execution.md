# Windows Library Files Code Execution
- 12.3.1 in Pen-200
- .Library-ms extension
## 2-Stage attack
1. Using a Windows Library File, we'll connect to a WebDav share. Victim receives a .Library-ms file, perhaps via email. When opened, this will open our library, appearing as a regular directory in Windows Explorer. 
2. We'll populate the WebDAV directory/share with a .LNK file, that executes a PowerShell RevShell. User must click the .LNK payload to execute.

The reason we don't just send the link, is to bypass email filter, spam filter, as a lot of the security technologies will ALLOW the .Library-ms file, but not the .LNK.
