### Dir traversal
Goal: To read or access files outside the web application's root directory.  
How: manipulate user-supplied input (like a filename in a URL parameter) by injecting the sequence ../ (or ..\ on Windows) to move up to parent directories in the file system.

### LFI - local file inclusion
Goal: To trick the web application into executing code from a file.  
How: uses DIR traversal techniques to reach local, non-web-root file  

### RFI - local file inclusion
Goal: Execute a file hosted on a remote server (controlled by the attacker).  
How: attacker provides a full URL pointing to a malicious script they control, and the vulnerable application fetches and executes it.  

### OS Command Injection
Goal: To execute commands (like ls, id, rm, or net user) directly on the server's operating system (OS).  
How: injects shell metacharacters (e.g., ;, &, |, &&) into an input field that the application then passes to a system function for execution. This causes the OS to see and run multiple distinct commands.
