# File Upload Vulnerabilities
- TCM File upload Attacks : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAFVGQ-lBoM
- Port Swigger Lab
- GOAL: Inject a malicious file or overwrite an existing one to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE).

What is being scrutinized by the server: 
POST /upload
filename="rev.php.png"
Content-Type: image/png

Questions to resolve:
What extensions are allowed? 
What happens if we change our extension from .png to php, pHP, php2?
If PNG changed to .php allowed: What happens if we change body and insert our PHP shell code? Can we access it and get a webshell?
What happens if we change our Content-Type: image/png to  application/php?
What happens with ../../../ file upload?
Change magic bytes from 'PNG' to 'PHP' or 'nonsense' 
What happens if we upload a really long filename, like 1000 'a' characters?  Short filenames?
Behavior when we Url-Encode the file name?
Zip the file we upload, or continously zip then upload?
